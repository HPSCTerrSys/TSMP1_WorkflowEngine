This file should contain a small log / documentation of the setu process for
FZJ-IBG3_Climatrun-Template.

Description: This repository (FZJ-IBG3_Climatrun-Template) does contain a kind
of template used to setup new TSMP simulation workflows. The idea is that main
features as for example the directory structure, auxiliary tools,
post-processing tools, monitoring scripts, etc. are usually the same for all
TSMP workflows. So collecting the main features within this template enables
us to quickly setup new simulations with all the features developed in the past.

The version number is used as a tag.
Version numbering:
MAJOR.Minor.patch
