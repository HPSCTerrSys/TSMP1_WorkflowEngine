# Description:
#   This is the config file to control settings for individual cases (CASE).
#   As loading config files can create many security issues, and reading config 
#   files with grouped variables is a more complex task (at least with pure 
#   bash), I decided to use the `git config` option. Git is more or less 
#   installed everywhere that I guess this is a nice synergy.
