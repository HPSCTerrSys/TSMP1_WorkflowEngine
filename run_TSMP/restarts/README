The first resatrt files for this simulation were generated as follow:
1) I took restart files from LPO runs and renamed, to get IC files 'most spunup as possible':
ParFlow:
>> cp /p/scratch/cjibg35/poshyvailo1/HiCam-CORDEX_EUR-11_MPI-ESM-LR_histo_r1i1p1_FZJ-IBG3-TSMP120EC_v00aJuwelsCpuProdTt-1949_2005/sim_output_heter_geology_improved_with_pfl_sink_14102020/restarts/parflow/cordex0.11_1992_12.out.press.00248.pfb ./parflow
>> mv parflow/cordex0.11_1992_12.out.press.00248.pfb parflow/cordex0.11_1978_12.out.press.00248.pfb
CLM:
>> cp /p/scratch/cjibg35/poshyvailo1/HiCam-CORDEX_EUR-11_MPI-ESM-LR_histo_r1i1p1_FZJ-IBG3-TSMP120EC_v00aJuwelsCpuProdTt-1949_2005/sim_output_heter_geology_improved_with_pfl_sink_14102020/restarts/clm/clmoas.clm2.r.1993-01-01-00000.nc ./clm/
>> mv clm/clmoas.clm2.r.1993-01-01-00000.nc clm/clmoas.clm2.r.1979-01-01-00000.nc

2) I did run one year of simulation with this Setup and used the latest restartfiles generated this way to force the final setup. This is needed, as LPO and I do use differet slopes wherefore river-corridors are different. To redistribute at least the surface water and place rivers the new 'new'/'correct' corridors one year of spinup is neede. I did not kept the 'origin' restarts from LPO as they should be archived with here setup and above we found information which I used.
ParFlow:
>> mv ./parflow/cordex0.11_1979_12.out.press.00248.pfb ./parflow/cordex0.11_1978_12.out.press.00248.pfb
CLM:
>> mv ./clm/clmoas.clm2.r.1980-01-01-00000.nc ./clm/clmoas.clm2.r.1979-01-01-00000.nc
