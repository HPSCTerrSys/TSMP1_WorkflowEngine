v2.1.0
======

commit:b83073516856d30c1ead945d2a7c5820c4fd119d
INT2LMv2.0.4
TSMPv1.2.3

Changes:
- add 'bunch-submission' to run multiple simulations (months) within one slurm submit. This can save many quiueing time.
- change smaller scripts to run on 'esm' partiotion instead of 'devel'
- easy implementaiton to control individual sub-steps. E.g. run only postpro and finishing.
- change loging in HISTORY.txt - tag is now included
- prepare monitoring, by adding monitoring/ dir, $BASE_MODITORINGDIR, and related git-ignore entry. Monitoring itself is still not availabel
- add and modif some aux_* tools
- porper mask ParFlow postpro in netCDF files
- add 'specific_storage' (ParFlow) to postpro
- change workflow that start_postpro now takes data from $BASE_SIMRES instead of rundir. Further start_simulation directly moves data to $BASE_SIMRES after simulation.

v2.0.0
======

commit:
INT2LMv2.0.4
TSMPv1.2.3

Changes:
- add `src/parflow/ParFlow_IO.py` needed by postpro
- add bunch of aux-tools
- remove JOBID from logfiles
- dd `missing_value` to Pfb2netCDF.py
- use CORDEX default for netCDF time-axis (ste time-step in between time-bnds
  for non-instantanous variables)
- add sha512sum for postpro/ and simres/
- add source-code changes needed for TSMP as patchfile to enable the user to 
  reproduce used TSMP version/setting
- update generation of HISTORY.txt
- clean up dir-structuer (e.g. remove very long 'version explaining' dirnames,
  which are from before using git).
- remove using template-dir. Static-files are now stored under geo/ and namelist
  are stored under ctrl/namelist/
- centralize initDate (very beginning of simulation)

BELOW IS DEPRICATED as I satrt a new versioning
-----

This file should contain a small log / documentation of the setu process for ERA5Climat runs.

General:
Different to 'usual strategy' development is done on the master branch and releases are 'splited' to individual branches.
This strategy is also used by big companies as Check24 and Trivago.
I want to test this!

Changes:
- IC/BC resolution 0.25 --> 0.3
- project cslts --> cjibg35
- OS change of compute and login nodes: OS7 --> OS8
- reworked dir-structure torwards 'final / ideal' structur
- add post-processing routines

v001_001
========

Setup:
INT2LMv2.0.4
Workflow from LPO 14102020
TSMPv1.2.1

ERA5 data are downloaded vi MARS retrieves on the same boundary as TSMP-Monitoring IC/BC but on 0.25degree resolution
The related MARSScript is located (copyed from ECGATE) in: ctrl/MARSScripts/
